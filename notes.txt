about 1:10 per turn
wheels 4 (far left-most) and 2 (inner right) start off with blank at top
wheels rotate in phase 1, 2, 3, 4 order from left to right
    phase 1: wheel 4 (far left-most) rotates
    phase 2: wheel 3 (inner left) rotates, etc
when a wheel rotates, it's blank (if it has one) is replace with a new symbol
a locked in "kill" triggers damage to start from whatever bar you're at
    so if you triggered kill on phase 4, then you'd have bars 0 - 4 for damage 
    trigger kill on 2, and you only have bars 3 - 4 for damage 
    wheels 1 and 3 always have remember in the first slot 
    wheels only reset after a damage phase

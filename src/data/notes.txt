about 1:10 per turn
wheels 1 (far left-most) and 3 (inner right) start off with blank at top
wheels rotate in phase 1, 2, 3, 4 order from left to right
    phase 1: wheel 1 (far left-most) rotates
    phase 2: wheel 2 (inner left) rotates, etc
when a wheel rotates, it's blank (if it has one) is replace with a new symbol
a kill read triggers damage to start from whatever bar you're at
    so if you triggered kill on phase 0, then you'd have 4 bars for damage 
    trigger kill on 2, and you only have 2 bars for damage 
    wheels 2 and 4 always have remember in the first slot 
    wheels only reset after a damage round 
    screens reset after damage or lockset engagement
    'active' wheel is lit during it's phase 
        eg, wheel 1 is lit from phase 0 to 1


progress bar:
    0: wheel 1 is read
    1: wheel 2 is read 
    2: wheel 3 is read 
    3: wheel 4 is read 
    4: reset to 0 

damage round:
    wheel that triggered kill is the only wheel that keeps kill, every other wheel has kill replaced 
    all screens actively match whats on the wheels
    x: damage starts

todo:
    wheel turn animation (probably a transition)
    number the wheels/locks visibly
    action bar scroll to new action 
    event log
        make sure "round start" event log messages show up before wheel turns (minor)
        filters:
            defaults to actions
            also options for wheel states (rotations, locks)
